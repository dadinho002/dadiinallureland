	<h4 style="font-style: oblique"> Chapter One: Dadi's magical adventure</h4>
    <p style="font-style: oblique">	In the whimsical realm called Earth, there lived a curious and imaginative boy named Dadi.</p>
    <p style="font-style: oblique">Dadi was unlike any other child in the realm he had a peculiar fascination with playing League. His favorite champ was none other than The Starry-eyed Songstress- Seraphine.</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">Every day, Dadi would venture into the Howling Abyss, a snowy bridge where poros reside, his mind filled with fantasies of finding a girl that would match his banter. He often tried using his only good line to find such a girl, however he had no success.</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">One sunny afternoon, while venturing Howling Abyss, Dadi stumbled upon a cute and fluffy poro. Before he could pet the Poro,the Poro ran away into a oversized tree stump that seemed out of place. He approached the situation cautiously, and to his amazement, he noticed a small, intricately carved door embedded within the stump. </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">It was reminiscent of the entrance to Wonderland itself. Excitement surged through Dadi's body. Without hesitation, he pushed the tiny door, and to his astonishment, it swung open, revealing a tunnel that seemed to descend deep into the Earth.</p>

    <p style="font-style: oblique">Fueled by curiosity and bravery, Dadi decided to embark on his own magical journey. He took a deep breath and ventured into the mysterious passage. The tunnel twisted and turned, and soon he found himself falling down, down, down.</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">When he landed, he found himself in a breathtaking garden filled with oversized flowers in vibrant hues. Before him stood a mischievous Poro grinning from ear to ear. The Poro welcomed Dadi to Allureland, a place where imagination and reality intertwined.</p>

	<h4 style="font-style: oblique"> Chapter Four: A punishment </h4>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">With a triumphant smile, Princess Christina delivered the final blow and declared victory. Though Dadi had fought valiantly, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment at his defeat.</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">"Congratulations, Princess Christina," Dadi conceded with a good-natured grin. "You've bested me fair and square."</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">Christina's smile softened with empathy as she observed Dadi's crestfallen expression. "Well played, Dadi," she replied kindly. "But in this game, there can only be one winner."</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">With a heavy heart, Dadi prepared to bid his companion goodnight, knowing that Princess Christina's kindness extended even to moments of defeat. However, as he moved to join her for their nightly routine, Christina gently interjected.</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">"Dadi," she began, her voice gentle but firm, "tonight, you must go to bed without my goodnight.“</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">Dadi's heart sank at Christina's words, realizing the gravity of his defeat. </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">With a solemn nod, Dadi bid Christina a silent goodnight and retired to his chambers, pondering the lessons learned from their game. </p>

 <p style="font-style: oblique">As the hours passed and the moon rose high above the castle walls, Dadi's frustration grew. He tried counting sheep, rearranging his pillows, and even humming a soothing lullaby, but nothing seemed to ease the restlessness that gripped him.</p>

	<h4 style="font-style: oblique"> Chapter Five: A new friend </h4>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">In the enchanting kingdom of Allureland, where whimsy danced on the breeze and magic sparkled in every corner, Princess Christina and her adventurous companion, Dadi, set out for a leisurely stroll through the lush forest. </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique"> Suddenly, a soft whimper caught their attention, drawing their gaze to a nearby grove. There, nestled beneath the shade of a towering oak tree, sat a small, scruffy dog. Its fur was matted and unkempt, and its gentle brown eyes were filled with longing. The sight tugged at Christina and Dadi's hearts, stirring a deep sense of compassion within them. </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">Approaching the timid creature with gentle smiles, Christina and Dadi extended their hands in friendship. The dog, sensing their kindness, tentatively approached, wagging its tail in gratitude. </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">"It seems this little one has lost its way," Christina remarked, her voice filled with empathy.</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">Dadi nodded in agreement, his eyes filled with concern. "We can't leave it here alone. What should we do?"</p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">Without hesitation, Christina reached out to scoop the dog into her arms, cradling it with tender care. "We shall bring him home with us," she declared with determination. "He will be a cherished member of our family." </p>
	
</div>
<div class="page text-page">
	<p style="font-style: oblique">And so, with their new furry friend in tow, Christina and Dadi returned to the royal palace. There, amidst the grandeur of their surroundings, they lovingly tended to the dog, bathing him, grooming his fur, and showering him with affection. </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">As they watched the once-lonely pup wag his tail with newfound joy, Christina and Dadi knew they had made the right decision. Together, they decided to name him Bobi—a name that seemed to suit his playful spirit perfectly </p>
	<p style="font-style: oblique">In the magical realm of Allureland, a chance encounter with a stray dog had blossomed into a beautiful friendship—one that would endure for a lifetime. And as they wandered through the enchanted forest, Christina, Dadi, and Bobi knew that together, they were truly home. </p>
